&gt; Starting in Spring, 2011, I teamed up with Dr. Weihong Lin, Biological Sciences department, and two undergraduate researchers, <b>Asmita Adhikari</b> and <b>Taylor Good</b>, to work on the role of TRPM5 ion channels in mouse olfactory signal processing. This work was supported mainly by an NSF-funded UBM grant between the Mathematics and Biological Sciences departments. The experimental protocol involved calcium imaging to monitor intracellular calcium levels in response to chemical stimuli in isolated olfactory sensory neurons from wild type and TRPM5-knockout mice. While the experiments proceeded on pace, the mathematical modeling was hampered by a dearth of critical parameter values. So a change in project goals accompanied a second set of student researchers coming into the project at the end of the internships of Asmita and Taylor. Calcium imaging studies involving two types of stimuli were designed to activate major and minor signaling pathways within the isolated olfactory cells. A dynamical mathematical model has been developed to better understand the two pathways. Student researchers <b>Andrew Coates</b> and <b>Jen Chang</b> have put together a poster presentation summarizing the results so far, and this work can be viewed <a href="SURF_Poster_12.pdf">here</a>.

&gt; Spring, 2011 I worked with two students, <b> Mobolaji Akinpelu </b>
and <b> Jordan White </b>. Mobolaji's project was to develop a program to
determine the steady state distribution of potential in a small tree graph
(modeling a dendritic tree) stimulated by a constant current source at one
boundary vertex. One goal of his project is to determine if we can
distinguish between two non-isotropic trees with identical boundary
vertices from the voltage measurements at the boundary vertices. Jordan's
project was to develop a working knowledge of a Python program called
NetworkX. This application was developed at Los Alamos to explore network
algorithms. Because of its flexibility, the project was to see what can be
said about solution behavior of partial differential equations imposed on
a graph versus its graph topology.

&gt; For Fall, 2009 and Spring 2010 I worked with student <b>Alexandria 
Volkening</b>. Our project was to develop a mathematical model of vulnerable arterial plaques
(thin-cap fibroatheromas, or TCFAs). TCFA ruptures are a major cause of heart
attacks. Our model accounts for the thinning and weakening of the cap due to the degradation effects
of the toxic plaque core and accumulation of contaminents within the "shoulders"
of the cap. Competing growth rates of the cap and core determine whether the rupture 
happens early or later in the growth process.

<br>
&gt; For Fall, 2008 and Spring, 2009 I worked with student 
<b>Alison Ebaugh</b>.
Our project was to see if a comprehensive quantitative model for the 
induction
and maintenance of chemical/structural modifications of synapses between 
certain types
of nerve cells can help explain a variety of experimental observations
concerning the long-term changes in synaptic strength due to specific types
of stimuli.

&gt; In Spring and summer sessions, 2008, I supervised training of
a MARC student, <b>Immanuel Williams</b>, where we engaged in two
projects from the area of pharmacodynamics. The first project involved
examining conditions for temperature oscillations in a mathematical
model for 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia. The second project involved
examining the dynamics of hepatitis C virus when pegylated interferon
is administered. That is, what happens when the viral load is not in
steady state when the drug is administered. He also made nice presentations
at the annual Summer Undergraduate Research Fest (SURF) in August, 2008. He
also did a presentation at the 2008 Annual Biomedical Research
Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) conference.
<br>
<br>
&gt; In Spring and summer sessions, 2007, I supervised training of
another MARC student, <b>Velvet Wright</b>, where we investigated a population 
model involving two competing species, both prey to a third (predator) population. 
She analyzed necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of such
population systems, and what effect harvesting has on sustaining the populations.
The two-competing-population system is unstabilty (one population with go to extinction),
the the presence of the predator population can stabilize the three populations. 
Moderate harvesting of the predator population can destabilize the prey populations.
She also gave presentations at 2007 SURF and the 2007 ABRCMS in Atlanta, where she won an outstanding
presentation award.

&gt; I was Principle Investigator on an NSF REU grant title "Summer
Program in Computational Biology", which was run for 8 weeks in the
summers of 2005, 2007, and 2008. Click on the program web site

previous projects.

<b>Regarding graduate student projects</b>
<br>
<br>
&gt; In the spring semester 2013 another Thai graduate student from
   Mahidol University, Wanwarat Anlamlert, visited to get started on a
      dissertation project with me. We worked on developing a model of the
         chemical dynamics in an arterial plaque. This is an initial effort in
            a longer term investigation to understand the growth and degradation
               of vulnerable plaques associated with cardiovascular disease.

&gt; In 2012 Joshua Austin started a masters degree project about an
                     inverse problem of finding a distributed parameter associated with a
                        wave equation on an interval of the real line. This work involves
                           modifying previous boundary control work with Dirichlet controls to
                              one with Neumann controls. The goal is to implement the theory in an
                                 efficient algorithm.

<br>
&gt; During academic year 2005-08 I have been working with UMBC
graduate student <b>Dan Wang</b> on a partial differential equation
constrained optimization approach to estimating a spatially distributed
spine density parameter in a model of a dendrite with spines. Professor
Florian Potra is co-advisor on this effort. She defended her thesis in
May, 2008. Her dissertation title was
"Partial Differential Equation Constrained Optimization and its Application
to Parameter Estimation in Models of Nerve Dendrites".

<br>

&gt; In the academic year 2006-7 I supervised research to a new Thai
student, <b>Kamonwan Kocharoen</b>, concerning a two-compartment model with
Hodgkin-Huxley type dynamics, but with modified sodium current terms. Geometric
perturbation analysis is used to reduce the model and analyze behavior. The 
solution behavior under various scenarios resembles clinical observations. The
model can explain differences between the action potential dynamics of a normal 
patient and those with myotonia or 
periodic paralysis. The work resulted in the paper
"Dynamic Analysis of a Model of Skeletal Muscles with Myotonia or Periodic
Paralysis",to appear, J. Nonlinear Studies. This work was part of her dissertation 
for a PhD at Mahidol University, Bangkok.

<br>
<br>
&gt; In 2005 I worked with a Thai student, <b>Sittipong Ruktamatakul</b>, on a
topic in neural field theory, resulting in the paper "Wave front
solutions and their shape for continuous neuronal networks with lateral
inhibition" (IMA J. Appl. Math. 71(2006),544-564). Our two-layer model has the first 
layer having inhibitory connections to the second layer, while the second layer
has excitatory connections to the first layer. The dynamics of each layer constitutes
partial differential integral equations. He shows the shape of the voltage wave depends very 
strongly on two parameters, the difference in time scales between layers, and a threshold parameter.
This work was part of
his dissertation for the PhD at Mahidol University, Bangkok.

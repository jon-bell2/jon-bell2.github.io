<h3>Some General Neuroscience Books:</h3>

<p><b>1. Principles of Neural Science</b>, by E.R. Kandel, J.H. Schwartz,
and T.M. Jessel, McGraw-Hill, 2000</p>

<p>This text presents a general background in neuroscience, covering
everything from genetics topics to developmental and behavioral aspects 
of neuroscience. It is also the only text that makes calculus books look 
small, but it has great graphics and pictures, and is well written.</p>

<p><b>2. Neurobiology</b>,by G.M. Shepherd, Oxford Univ. Press, 1994</p>

<p>This is probably the only text that competes with the Kandel-Schwartz-Jessel 
text, again being very comprehensive and well written introduction (and a 
more manageable size).</p>

<h3>Some Mathematical/Computational Neuroscience Books:</h3>

<p><b>1. Theoretical Neuroscience</b>, by P. Dayan and L.F. Abbott, MIT
Press, 2001</p>


<p>This is a brand new text by outstanding researchers. I am enthusiastic about
this book but I thought the amount of math preparation required would be more
than our text, but there is a world of information in this book.</p>

<p><b>2. Introduction to Theoretical Neurobiology, vol. 1, 2</b>, by H.C. Tuckwell, 
Cambridge Univ. Press, 1988</p>

<p>This text covers a lot of cable theory, including Rall's equivalent cylinder theory
of dendritic branching, along with even stochastic modeling topics. I view it more as
a graduate text, and there is not a lot of empirical studies discussed.</p>

<p><b>3. Biophysics of Computation</b>, by C. Koch, Oxford Univ. Press,
1999</p>

<p>This book focuses on information processing in single neurons and is
pretty comprehensive in that way. Some of the math is handled carelessly, but there 
is a lot of good topic here.</p>

<p><b>4. The Computational Brain</b>, by P.S. Churchland and T.J. Sejnowski,
MIT Press, 1992</p>

<p>This is a rather unique text as a collaboration between a computational neuroscientist
and a behaviorial neurophysiologist. They try to link up neurobiological work with
neural network paradigms in a rather conversational style, minimizing the math.</p>

<p><b>5. The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks</b>, by M.A. Arbib (ed.),
MIT Press, 1998</p>

<p>This is really a collection of short papers, but covering a hugh number of topics, 
and being well cross-referenced.</p>

<p><b>6. Electric Current Flow in Excitable Cells</b>, by J.J.B. Jack, D. Noble, and R.W.
Tsien, Clarendon Press, 1975</p>

<p>This is one of the early texts in the area, somewhat dated now, but has material found
nowhere else.</p>

<p><b>7. Modeling in the Neurosciences, from ionic channels to neural networks</b>, by 
R.R. Poznanski (ed.), Harwood Academic Press, 1999</p>

<p><b>8. Methods in Neuronal Modeling, from synapses to networks</b>, by C. Koch and 
I. Segev (eds.), MIT Press, 1989</p>

<p>Both items 7 and 8 are collections of articles covering important topics in mathematical 
neurosciences.</p>

<h3>A Few General Biomathematics Books:</h3>

<p><b>1. Mathematical Models in Biology</b>, by L. Edelstein-Keshet,
Random House, 1988</p>

<p><b>2. Mathematical Physiology</b>, by J. Keener and J. Sneyd, Springer, 1998</p>

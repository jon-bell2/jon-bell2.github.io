<B><P>Text</B>: Charles R. MacCluer, <B>Industrial Mathematics: Modeling in Industry, Science, and Government</B>, Prentice-Hall, 2000.</P>

<B><P>Prerequisites</B>: MATH 251, MATH 225, MATH 221, STAT 355, or consent of the instructor. Some programming experience is recommended.</P>

<P>Objective of this course is the survey of mathematical and statistical techniques traditionally important to quantitative modeling in industry and government. The course is designed for students in the mathematical sciences who expect to work in industry or government agencies in some technical capacity. It is expected that you have some grounding in fundamentals of mathematical science, including some basic statistics and computational mathematics exposure, but you may not be grounded in the practice of mathematics in the workplace. Mathematical topics I anticipate discussing (but I may alter or augment this list as I go along) are</P>

<UL>
<LI>Statistical ideas</LI>
<LI>Data acquisition</LI>
<LI>Linear programming</LI>
<LI>Regression</LI>
<LI>Scaling, dimensional analysis</LI>
<LI>Ordinary differential equations</LI>
<LI>Partial differential equations</LI></UL>

<P>The course is not designed to substitute for any specialized course covering these topics in detail, but rather to link a survey of (mostly undergraduate program) techniques to applications. The emphasis here is for you to have enough &quot;tools in your toolbox&quot; to attack a variety of technical problems, and think about problem approaches from different angles. You will not become master applied problem solvers after one course, but it will be intense enough that the ‘stage will be set’ for the goals we envision for the Industrial Mathematics Masters degree program. You may have to pick up extra background from other sources as we go along since the text is pretty terse. </P>

<P>I will expect that student participants have some understanding of LaTeX, or a technical equivalent (or are willing to pick up basics of these on the side) since there will be reports as well as homework due in the course.  This also goes for some programming language with graphing capability, like MatLab. That is, there is a bit of the industrial mentality working here, namely, &quot;I have a problem to solve, so you find a way to solve it.&quot;</P>

<B><P>Course structure and grading</B>: Another goal I would like for the course is for students to gain some experience in team work and report writing, so I am planning for each student to participate in some projects along with doing regularly assigned homework assignments.  At this time (6/14/02) I do not have all the detailed worked out in my mind, but I anticipate a couple of projects to be done in a team environment, but the last one being a solo effort. The size of the team/group (and some other decisions about course management) will depend on the enrollment in the course. The projects will be chosen with my advice and consent, and I will be available for consultation on them. Accompanying the completion of the projects I am also thinking about having students do oral presentations, but some of this is predicated on the time I can allow for them. </P>
<P>A word about collaborating on work: I encourage working in groups, both for homework, going over class material, and projects. But write-ups of the homework must be done individually, and any work involving simulations must be done by everyone individually. </P>

<B><P>Course conduct</B>: The university is very sensitive be instances of academic misconduct, and faculty are charged with enforcing academic integrity. I support this and have adopted a statement from the Provost’s office:</P>

<P>By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s scholarly community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal. To read the full Student Academic Conduct Policy, consult the UMBC Student Handbook, the Faculty Handbook, or the UMBC Policies section of the UMBC Directory.</P>

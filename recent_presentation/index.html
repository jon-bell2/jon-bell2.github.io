<br>
Abstract: Central questions in ecology seek explanation for distribution,
abundance, and co-existence of species. It is well known that competitive
exclusion can occur between species competing for a resource where one
species may drive another species to extinction. However, the presence of
a predator can force the mediation of a coexistent state between the
species. We ask whether a repulsive prey defense mechanism can upset
predator-mediated coexistence. We discuss one scenario involving two
competing species with a common predator. All three populations are mobile
via random dispersal within a bounded spatial domain. We will first define
predator-mediated coexistence, then the notion of prey-taxis. This
mechanism influences the predator's movement leading to various spatial
distributions. We present an existence result, discuss existence of
non-constant steady states through bifurcation, and through numerical
simulation show the model captures a range of spatial patterns when small
perturbations to the homogeneous steady state are made.

<a href="CapModel.pdf">A model of arterial plaque cap development and degradation</a>
<br>
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the US,
and a common form of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis. This is an inflammatory disease of the large and medium arteries due to plaques that develop
in the arterial wall. In modeling development of a lesion in an
artery wall, there are a number of chemotactic mechanisms going on within
the wall layer that lead to an arterial plaque with fibrous cap. We introduce a model involving some of these dynamic processes, 
present some theoretical results, do some simulations, and examine the implications of the model
results. Our main goal of the project is to isolate potential mechanisms that lead to plaque rupture through thinning of the fibrous cap.

<a href="OctODUtalk.pdf">Challenges in understanding atherosclerotic plaque rupture: a mathematical modeling strategy</a>
<br>
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the US and many developed countries. Atherosclerosis is a major contributor to this
 disease profile. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of major arteries due to fatty lesions forming in arterial walls, causing
 stenosis (contracting blood flow) and thrombosis (blood clots, blockage). Certain 
 lesions, called vulnerable plaques, are responsible for most deaths from atherosclerosis. The growth and degradation of these plaques is very
 dynamic, involving complex biochemical, hemodynamic, and mechanical interactions. But the present experimental means for studying arterial
 plaque development is limited, calling for augmenting such studies by mathematical modeling, analysis, and simulation. In this talk I will
 give a background to the biology and outline a strategy for model development,
 starting with an ODE model of principle chemical and cellular processes, and progressing to more complicated PDE models that include more
 mechanisms. At this stage little is proved, so the talk should be viewed as a possible roadmap for approaching a variety of questions. The major
 one for me is why do some plaques become unstable and rupture, while others do not.

<br>
Abstract: Medical research has indicated that abnormalities of skeletal muscles, myotonia and periodic paralysis, are caused by alteration in the voltage-gated sodium channels. This assumption led to studies of channel behavior based on the dynamics of membrane potentials. Cannon, et al developed a two-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley type model that had a reformulation of the sodium current term and did some simulations to compare with experiment. Here we discuss a geometric perturbation analysis on the model system, reducing it from an eight-order system to a third-order system. The conditions on the system parameters under which the model exhibits dynamic behavior that resembles clinical observations are derived. We are able to detect slow-fast limit cycles which generate bursts of action potentials characteristic of the clinical case where active and non-active phases are observed to alternate in a pulsatile fashion, such as that in patients with Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. Relying on the observation that the state variables possess drastically diversified dynamics, we explain the differences between the action potential dynamics of a normal subject and those of myotonia or periodic paralysis cases. The model seems to display mixed-mode oscillations that need further analysis.

<br>
Abstract: Dendritic tree morphology is basically a finite, compact metric tree graph. We extend neuronal cable theory to certain types of graphs, and attack a number of forward and inverse problems. For inverse problems, given certain types of (biologically relevant) boundary measurements, we not only want to determine lengths and radii of branches, or conductances given the other parameters, but also to recover the tree morphology. One of the techniques we will employ here is the Boundary Control method, which has been effectively used for inverse problems in mathematical physics. For forward problems, we have formulated energy and comparison principle methods in order to examine nonlinear behavior, particularly threshold and conduction properties for use on graph domains. Along with these analytical approaches an important goal will be to develop effective numerical algorithms to recover (spatially distributed) parameters from graph boundary measurements and solution behavior on our graph domains. We have partial results on all subproblems discussed, and are actively pursuing further development of the ideas.

<br>
Abstract: The goal in this talk is to discuss the inverse problem of recovering a single spatially distributed conductance parameter in a cable theory model (one-dimensional diffusion equation) defined on a finite tree graph. We employ a boundary control method that gives a unique reconstruction and an algorithmic approach. The motivation for this work is that dendrites of nerve cells are tree-like graphs, which have non-uniformly distributed physical parameters, one being channel conductance. It is also one of the first studies of the application of boundary control methods to inverse problems of parabolic problems on graphs, and one of the first uses of the method in this application area. This is collaborative work with Sergei Avdonin, U. Tennessee at Chattanooga.

Abstract: The boundary control method is an approach to inverse problems
based on the relationship between control and systems theory. I will
first give some motivation for studying certain inverse problems, then
reduce the problem to a "simple" case. Then I will develop aspects of
the boundary control method in a way that leads to an algorithmic
approach for estimating a certain distributed parameter. I will wrap up
with comments about other problems I am, or would like to attack. This

Abstract: This presentation introduces two different scenarios where it is appropriate to consider partial differential equations on (quantum) tree graph domains. The first example concerns threshold and conduction properties from neuronal cable theory on a nerve's dendritic tree. The second example concerns species persistence in a river network. A variety of unanswered questions will also be mentioned.

Abstract: We are interested in the qualitative behavior of diffusion

   discuss analytical results concerning threshold conditions, traveling
   wave solutions, bounds on conduction speed, and conduction block. As
   time permits we will mention work on an (inverse) problem in linear

<br>
   Abstract: In this presentation I will start with models of a single
   population, concentrating on historic models in a non-spatial setting.
   Next I move to addressing population dynamics when there is mobility
   via a diffusion mechanism. After presenting some solution behavior, we
   move on to an advection-driven setting, like a simple creek
   environment, then a branched environment (river network). After this I
   return to basics of adding a second, competitive, species, first
   discussing the competitive exclusion principle in a single compartment
   setting, then discussing how the picture changes in the presence of
   diffusion and advection. I will finish with presenting some problems
   worth pursuing. The presentation is designed to be reasonably
   accessible to students with some differential equations background,
   but should raise some interesting, but unresolved questions in
   dynamics of populations.

<br>
Abstract: We discuss analysis and simulations associated with a model
system consisting of two competing populations and one common predator
population; all populations are mobile (random dispersal), but the
predator\222s movement is influenced by one prey's gradient representing a
chemorepulsive effect on the predator population. There is no adaptive
mechanism in the present model. We examine pattern formation through
bifurcations with respect to the chemotactic sensitivity parameter, and
the prey diffusivity parameter. We also mention existence and convergence
to steady state results. This work is in collaboration with Evan Haskell
(Nova Southeastern University, Ft. Lauderdale, FL).

vulnerable to rupture: a mathematical modeling perspective</a>
<br>
Abstract: While most arterial plaques are stable, a percentage of plaques
become vulnerable to rupture, causing heart attacks, strokes, or organ
damage, depending on their location. The main question is to pin down
trigger mechanisms that destabilize a plaque.  Biochemical, mechanical and
hemodynamic mechanisms are involved. We model the cellular and chemical
dynamics in a maturing plaque, where a fibrous cap is developing and
chemotaxis plays a significant role. We explain cross-chemotaxis,
presenting some theory and simulations. As time permits, we then briefly
discuss the role of blood shear stress on the endothelial cell layer, and
how to incorporate this mechanism into our plaque model.

Abstract: For a parabolic equation defined on a tree graph domain, a
dynamic Neumann-to-Dirichlet map associated with the boundary vertices can
be used to recover the topology of the graph, length of the edges, and
unknown coefficients and source terms in the equation. The motivation for
this investigation is that the parabolic equation comes from a (linear)
neuronal cable equation defined on the dendritic tree of a neuron, and the
inverse problem concerns parameter identification of k unknown distributed
conductance parameters. The talk is based on joint work with Sergei
Avdonin (University of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Short Bio</span><br>
<br>
I grew up in Miami and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Before going to college
I worked at <br>
everything from being an assistant trainer at a sea aquarium, a scuba
diver, an import <br>
company jack-of-all-trades, a common seaman on a Bahamas cruise ship,
and a clarinet <br>
tutor. I completed a bachelors degree and masters degree in mathematics
at San Diego <br>
State University. In my masters thesis I proved some old algebraic
topology results in <br>
a new way using spectral sequences. I went to UCLA for doctoral work,
obtaining a PhD <br>
degree in Applied Mathematics in 1977. My dissertation involved
development of a <br>
mathematical model for the electrical activity of a nerve in the worm
Myxicola, and <br>
proving the existence of propagating action potentials using
topological ideas and <br>
perturbation theory. My first academic appointment was at Texas A&amp;M
University, then in <br>
1981 went to the Department of Mathematics at SUNY at Buffalo where I
got promoted in <br>
1983 to associate professor, and again at the beginning of 1990 as full
professor. I <br>
spent sabbatical time in the 1980s at Oxford University, Heriot-Watt
University, and <br>
National Institutes of Health. I was department chair from 1997-2000. I
left Buffalo <br>
in 2000 to take the appointment as professor and chair of Mathematics
and Statistics <br>
Department at UMBC. I stepped down as Chair in July, 2006, and continued on as <br>
Professor of Mathematics until September, 2014, at which time I retired. I am now
Emeritus <br>
Professor, and at present cruising the east coast of the US on my
motor yacht AfterMath.<br>
<br>
A passion I have had life-long has been messing around with boats. To

Paper 1 (by De Leo and Dobson) concerns an SI model where the underlying population is not held constant, but follows a
logistic growth model. Other elements not discussed in class concern incorporating an excess death rate due to the
disease, and distinguishing between a density-dependent disease transmission rate, and a frequency-dependent disease
transmission rate.

Paper 2 (Longini, et al) is a simulation study concerned with the avian flu (influenza H5N1) and the effectiveness of
various intervention strategies. This is a very current topic of interest, and they discuss such issues as age-specific
illness attack rates, constructing social network groups for contacts to transmit flu, etc.

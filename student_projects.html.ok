<span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent Student Projects</span><br>
<br>
Projects with non-thesis students include "Modeling epileptogensis
mechanisms in <br>
hippocampus" with Rebecca McFarland, first-year graduate student in
Biology, UMBC, and <br>
"computational modeling of neural degeneration in the hippocampus",
with Tywana Groce, <br>
undergraduate mathematics major, Hampton University. Click here to read
abstracts on <br>
these projects. I am also a principle investigator on an NSF REU grant
to run a summer <br>
research experiences for undergraduates in computational biology. Click

to got to the summer programs web site.<br>
<br>
Regarding graduate student projects, in 2005 I worked with Thai student
Sittipong <br>
Ruktamatakul on a topic in neural field theory, resulting in the paper
"Wave front <br>
solutions and their shape for continuous neuronal networks with lateral
inhibition". <br>
This work was part of his dissertation for the PhD at Mahidol
University, Bangkok. <br>
During academic year 2005-06 I have been working with UMBC graduate
student Dan Wang on <br>
a partial differential equation constrained optimization approach to
estimating a <br>
spatially distributed spine density parameter in a model of a dendrite
with spines. <br>
The work is being written up now.&nbsp; In Fall I will again supervise
research to a new Thai <br>
student, Kamonwan Kocharoen in work to be determined.<br>
